//A class is a blueprint for object construction.
//A class describes the behaviour of an object.
//An object is an entity that can do work for you when you invoke methods on them.
//A method is a sequence of instructions that access the data of an object.

A variable is a storage location with a name.
Primitive Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Data types specify the operations that can be performed on a variable.

An object performs work for you when you invoke methods on them.
All objects of a given class share a common set of methods.

String objects are immutable.
String methods:
length() returns the length of a string.
toUpperCase() returns a string with all characters in uppercase. toLowerCase() does the opposite.
replace() carries out a search-and-replace operation. It replaces all occurrences of target with replacement.
String river = Mississippi
river.replace(Ã¯ssipp, our) -> Missouri

The methods of a class form the public interface of a class.
The public interface of a class specifies what you can do with its objects.
The private implementation describes the data inside the objects & the instructions inside the methods.

An access modifier specifies the scope of a method, variable, class or constructor.
Methods with the same name, return type but different arguments is said to be overloaded. e.g. print(string output), print(int output)

The process of creating an object is called construction.
The new keyword is used to construct objects.
The values supplied to a constructor are called construction arguments.
