By default, all shapes and strings are drawn with a black pen.
To change the color of the pen, you need to supply an object of type Color.
Java uses the RGB model. - This means when you specify a color, you specify the 
amounts of primary colors that make up the color.
The amounts are given as integers between 0 & 255. 255 means maximum amount present and 0 means primary color not present.
The greater the integer, the greater the presence of primary color.

e.g. Color magenta = new Color(255, 0, 255) means maximum red, no green, maximum blue.
The Color class has a predefined set of colors for your convenience.

To draw a shape in a different color, first set the color of the Graphics2D object, then use the draw() method.
e.g. g2.setColor(Color.RED);
g2.draw(shape);

If you want to color the inside of the shape, use the fill() method instead.
g2.setColor(Color.GREEN);
g2.fill(shape);
