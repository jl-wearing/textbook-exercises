 * 2)double-quotation marks
 * 3)heredocs

/*
 * Double-quoted strings allow variables to be processed by their values.

/*
 * Punctuation marks following variables are ok because they are not
 * valid characters to include in variable names.
 * escape sequences are valid too.
 *
 * However, if you want other characters to immediately follow a variable,
 * you have to enclose the variable in curly braces.

 *
 * One use of nowdocs is for printing out PHP code.
