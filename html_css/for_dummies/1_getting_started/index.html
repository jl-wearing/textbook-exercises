<h1>What Do HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Do?</h1>
<p>They are technologies behind what appears when you visit a page o the web.<br/>
This is a very surface level explanation of their function.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>HTML Function:</h2>
<p>Structure: The basic scaffolding of the page, such as he page headings, the text paragraphs, and where the images appear.
This is the realm of HTML.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>CSS Function:</h2>
<p>Style: How the page looks, including fonts, colors, and margins.<br>
This is the function of CSS.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>JavaScript Function:</h2>
<p>Dynamism: Extras that make the page perform actions such as interacting with the user, "listening" for mouse clicks and key-presses and writing content to the page based on certain conditions. <br>
This is the job of JavaScript.</p>
