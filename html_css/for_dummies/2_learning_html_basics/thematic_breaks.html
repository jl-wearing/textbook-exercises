    <title>Horizontal Rule</title>

<body>
    <p>
        For these kinds of thematic breaks, HTML offers the hr element. The name is short
        for horizontal rule, and the element does just what it says: It draws a horizontal
        rule (that’s a line to the likes of you and me) clear across the page. The result?
        A nice, clean visual indication that the next paragraph is in some way a break
        from the previous one. Figure 1-7 offers an example where I’ve placed an &lt;hr&gt; tag between this paragraph
        and
        the next one

        Now it’s time to take these page-structure ramblings to the next level with an in
        depth look at HTML’s so-called semantic page elements. After you’ve mastered the
        tags I cover in the next section, you’ll know everything you need to know to build
        pages with good digital bones.
