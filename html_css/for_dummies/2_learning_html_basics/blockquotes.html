                Here's what the great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. had to say about puns:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return.
                But if a blow were given for such cause, and death
                ensued, the jury would be judges both of the facts
                and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an
                aggravated character, return a verdict of justifiable
                homicide.
            </blockquote>

                                                                                                          is someone
            who shticks by his word.</q>
