    <h1>Getting to Know HTML's Basic Structure Tags</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most important concepts you need to understand as you get started with HTML is that whatever text
        you shoehorn between the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; thags has almost no structure. To show you what I
        mean, I copied the first few headings and paragraphs of this section and pasted them into an HTML file.
        Figure 1-1 shows what happens when I open the HTML file in a web browser.

    <p>
        The resulting web page is anything but pretty and is very
        hard to read. Why? Because unlike the nicely structured — and
        therefore eminently readable — text you're eyeballing right
        now, all that structure got thrown out the window when I
        pasted the text into the HTML file. Remember, HTML files are
        really just plain text files, so all the fancy formatting and
        styles that were in my original Microsoft Word document were
        discarded.
